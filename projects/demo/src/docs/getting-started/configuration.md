# Configuration

Provision your IoT infrastructure in minutes instead of months.

## IoT infrastructure

Many IoT projects start with trying to get device data flowing to the cloud and it’s not an easy task. Using Fathym’s low-code framework, developers can create emulated data sets and configure an entire IoT infrastructure in minutes.  

As a developer, this allows you to verify your end-to-end IoT infrastructure is working as expected and data is flowing to the correct outputs before tackling the challenge of connecting real devices. This also allows you to verify the device data needed for the best ROI before sinking time and cost into sensor deployment.
