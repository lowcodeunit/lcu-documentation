# Introduction to LCUs

Low Code Units (LCUs) are the building blocks that make up your Application. 

## Fathym’s low-code IoT framework takes that complexity away.

Fathym’s low-code framework is designed to give developers the freedom and best practice workflows to rapidly create IoT and data-driven applications that are agnostic to tools, platforms and clouds. 

Each element of the framework is built from Low Code Units (LCUs) – modular building blocks of code that can be as large as an application, or as small as a data visualization. 

The framework drastically cuts down development time by applying and automating a set of best practices. The cloud infrastructure Fathym sits on is Microsoft Azure (and soon AWS and Google Cloud). You can set up an automated, enterprise-grade, Azure-hosted environment with just a few clicks. 

Developers can launch enterprise-scale solutions with all needed IoT infrastructure without any prior expertise in cloud provisioning. Organizations can customize their own frameworks to support their best practices and preferred tool sets.
